How has politics already been shaped and disrupted by technology and artificial intelligence (AI)?

## Event Overview
/
/
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is characterized by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds. Artificial intelligence (AI) is central to this new era, and its influence on our lives is growing quickly. Given the enormity and breathtaking pace of technological change — not to mention its tremendous promise and potential peril — it is critical to examine the roles of policy, politics, and ethics in shaping emerging technology and vice versa.

Researchers in Cornell’s Tech Policy Lab warn of the expanding gap between technology and policy and draw upon the broadest range of disciplines to understand how AI can empower as well as pose challenges to governments. Cornell’s Moral Psychology research group in our Sage School of Philosophy leads the world in the study of ethical human behavior and is applying the framework of moral decision making to the complex issues related to the ethical use of technology in the 4IR.

Join us for an interactive discussion with leading experts on the enormous changes and considerations in how we can enact policy that supports democracy and an ethical society.

This event is hosted by Ray Jayawardhana, the Harold Tanner Dean of Arts & Sciences, as part of the Arts Unplugged series. It is sponsored by the College of Arts & Sciences and Alumni Affairs and Development.
