At the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, we focus on the politics of technology. We study the way emerging technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and cyber are disrupting the political landscape in the United States and around the globe.

Some of the most consequential developments of the last two decades sit squarely at the intersection of technology and politics:

* The deployment of drones to revolutionize counterterrorism
* The manipulation of social media to influence foreign elections
* The pursuit of artificial intelligence to fuel a new global arms race
* The use of scientific models to formulate Covid-19 public health policies

All of these policies have technological innovation at their core, but their design and implementation have influenced domestic and international politics. 

In the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, we break down academic silos and foster radical interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of politics and technology.  We conduct research into the ways that emerging tech can disrupt politics; conduct empirical tests of those ideas; and innovate industry applications that build on those concepts and evidence.
